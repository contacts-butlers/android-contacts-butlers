# Contacts Butler

![Contacts Butler Banner](/banner.png)

Do you have a bunch of contacts that are missing a lot of info such as names, emails, phone numbers, 
etc? Do you really know the contacts you saved? Did you save the same contact several times? Are 
your favorite contacts really deserving of being favorites? Do you  want to groom your contacts a 
bit, whenever you are bored, have free time, or just fed up with being disorganized? 

Well, then, you have come to the right place! This application provides you the personification of 
the contributors in the open source community in the form of butlers. Every butler has their own 
personality and expertise. Different butlers will detect different contacts that need grooming based 
on different sets of needs. All butlers have one thing in common. They will help you groom your 
contacts using the power of LOVE <3

For a list of all butlers, who they are and what they do, read [BUTLERS.md](/BUTLERS.md)

## Free, open source software (FOSS)

This software is made by the community, for the community and everyone else <3

## Beginner-friendly contributions

We urge you, yes YOU, to contribute to this FOSS. Whether you are just in elementary, high school,
college, a professional, or just curious about Android development, you are welcome to contribute! 

The contribution philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible while still using the latest 
and greatest tech such as those included in [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

This repository is split up in to as many different modules as possible in order to;

- give contributors a sense of ownership and personalization of their own module
- cater to the differing levels of expertise in Android
- modularize the app, which is, to summarize, a good practice

Let's have fun building this app and remember that the most important thing is to get a working, 
pleasant FOSS product.
