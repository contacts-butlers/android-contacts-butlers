# Contacts Butler

![Contacts Butler Banner](/banner.png)

Do you have a bunch of contacts that are missing a lot of info such as names, emails, phone numbers, 
etc? How much do you really know the contacts you saved? Did you save the same contact several 
times? Are your favorite contacts really deserving of being favorites? Does your spouse or partner
really love you? 

If you want answers to all of these questions, then you have come to the right place! This 
application provides you the personification of the contributors in the open source community in 
the form of butlers. Using the power of LOVE, our butlers will ensure that your contacts are fully 
groomed <3

This is not your typical "contacts cleaner" app!

## Free, open source software (FOSS)

This software is made by the community, for the community and everyone else <3

## Beginner-friendly contributions

We urge you, yes YOU, to contribute to this FOSS. Whether you are just in elementary, high school,
college, a professional, or just curious about Android development, you are welcome to contribute! 

The contribution philosophy is to keep things as simple as possible while still using the latest 
and greatest tech such as those included in [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

Let's have fun building this app and remember that the most important thing is to get a working, 
pleasant FOSS product.

For a list of all butlers and the jobs they do, read [BUTLERS.md](/BUTLERS.md).

You can be a butler too! Read more on how to contribute in [CONTRIBUTING](/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
