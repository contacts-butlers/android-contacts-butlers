# Contacts Butler

![Contacts Butler Banner](/banner.png)

Do you have a bunch of contacts that are missing a lot of info such as names, emails, phone numbers, 
etc? Do you really know the contacts you saved? Did you save the same contact several times? Are 
your favorite contacts really deserving of being favorites? Do you  want to groom your contacts a 
bit, whenever you are bored, have free time, or just fed up with being disorganized? 

Well, then, you have come to the right place! This application provides you your own personalized 
butler that will help you groom your contacts =) 

## Free, open source software (FOSS)

This software is made by the community, for the community and everyone else <3

## Beginner-friendly contributions

We urge you, yes YOU, to contribute to this FOSS. Whether you are just in elementary, high school,
college, or a professional, you are welcome to contribute! The contribution philosophy is to keep
things as simple as possible while still using the latest and greatest tech such as those included
in [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack).

This repository is split up to as many different modules as possible in order to;

- cater to the differing levels of experience in Android
- give contributors a sense of ownership and expertise
- modularize the app, which is in short a good practice

Let's have fun building this app and remember that the most important thing is to get a working, 
pleasant product.
