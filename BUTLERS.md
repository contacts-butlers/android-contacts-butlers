# Butlers 

People from the open source community, as butlers, using the power of love <3

## Butler Vandolf (since v1.0.0)

Butler Vandolf has been here since the very beginning. He is the original ~~vampire~~ butler. He 
is awkward and has a weird sense of humor. He likes to serve and help others solve their problems. 
He really wants to belong and blend in with the open source community... Overall, a really nice 
~~vampire~~ guy =)

**Specialization:** Groom owner contact profile 

B-Vandolf specializes in getting to know the owner of the device. He will make sure that the owner 
contact profile is a little bit groomed, allowing all other butlers to personalize how they 
communicate with the owner.

## Butler Android (since v1.0.0)

Butler Android has been summoned by B-Vandolf to help groom contacts using its own tools. B-Android 
likes to get everyone "be together, not the same". B-Android, as the name implies, is a robot.

**Specialization:** Give names to nameless contacts

B-Android specializes in making sure all contacts have names. B-Android gets sad otherwise =(
